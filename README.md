# wofi-calc
A simple calculator for wofi, inspired in rofi-calc.

## Install from AUR

    yay -S wofi-calc

## Install from github
    
    makepkg -sri

## To use it run

    wofi-calc

## TODOS:

* Optimize the script to emulate rofi-calc in a closest way. Currently there's a noticeable delay delay between operations.
